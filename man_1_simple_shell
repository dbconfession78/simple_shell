.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.PP
If the name is not a builtin, and contains no slashes, GoS searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.PP
If the search is successful, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.
